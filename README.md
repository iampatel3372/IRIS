# IRIS
This is very basic ML Problem. Here we need to classify the types of flowers based on the given features. 

## Dataset
Dataset contains 150 data points with 50 versicolor, 50 verginica, 50 setosa flowers.
There are 4 features for each data points : petal_legth, petal_width, sepal_length, sepal_width.


## Observations :

* petal length and petal width are most useful features to indetify various flower types.
* While setosa can be easily indentified(linearly separable), Verginica and Versicolor have some overlap.
* WE can find lines and if-else conditions to build a simple model to classify the flower types.
